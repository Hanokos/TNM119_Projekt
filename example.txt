Small noisy and no service.......even by "European Standards"...
Just checked in....Incredibly noisy.....You must be kidding. Small rooms have set a new standard and that is saying a lot. There is NO place to put anything. How did they find such small desk? The A/C does not work and there is no way to contact the front desk from the room. The bathroom is the highlight. You might even consider sleeping there as it is about as big as the main room. This is case of you get far less than what you paid for.,  ,1
